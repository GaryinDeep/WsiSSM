WsiSSM: Weakly Supervised Learning with Subset-matching Strategy for Histopathology Whole Slide Images Classification and Segmentation

Official PyTorch implementation of WsiSSM (Sparse-CAM backbone + Subset-Matching).

A weakly supervised framework that unifies classification and segmentation on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) using only slide-level labels. It achieves state-of-the-art segmentation among MIL methods while keeping strong diagnostic performance.
